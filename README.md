# emotion_recognition_music_player
1.For this u need to have a songs and images of different emotions dataset or u can directly create a folder of images and songs under which different emotions sub folders containing images are placed.
2.U need to place facecrop pyhton in every sub folder and run it which converts into grey scale images.
3.Then run the webcam python file which captures the image from webcam and detects its emotion and play corresponding emotions song 
in a music player.
NOTE: This emotion detection is just for knowledge purpose not at all accurate to apply in real world applications.
